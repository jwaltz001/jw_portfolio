					I began my career serving in a ministry position at a Catholic Church in central California. As the newly created head of high school and young adult faith formation, I had to learn how to balance the independence that was afforded to me with the need to seek help from others and to delegate tasks where I could. My passion for the teaching aspects of my job, as well as my close work with the Catholic school there, inspired me to pursue opportunities in the educational field.

					As I looked into moving back home to Texas, I sought an opportunity as a teacher, and found an opening at a Catholic junior high school. After three years teaching junior high and honing my pedagogical techniques and practical skills, e.g. getting a group of 7th graders to focus their energy on learning, I decided to further challenge myself by seeking a position at the new (at the time it was only in its second year of operation) nearby Catholic high school. I experience growth in many areas both personally and professionally while working and helping to establish the school community there. My time as a teacher allowed me to develop and use my talent at speaking and group addresses as well as my desire to teach and help others understand concepts more fully. I am proud to have been able to cultivate a culture of questioning and learning in my classroom.

				My passion for computer programming began with a series of conversations I had with a friend who is a programmer himself. With his encouragement, and after conducting personal research into the field, and spending time in personal reflection and conversations with my wife, I decided to look into a computer programming boot camp. This change in the path of my career has reinvigorated my love of logical problem solving in a new and powerful way. Through my experience in the bootcamp, I have been able to learn and work in deeply engaging and fascinating way. The logical and functional way of thinking involved in programming comes very natural to me, and I wake up every morning (at the start of what are very long, immersive days) excited at the prospect of what the future holds.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
				I find great satisfaction being able to think through problems and concepts to find solutions that are both innovative and comprehensive. Using my experience as a teacher has come into play not only in seamlessly transitioning into a new learning environment, but also in the ability to help my classmates and myself understand and explain important ideas and concepts as we go through the program together. As I launch a career in computer programming, Iâ€™m looking to work in a role where learning and growth is highly valued and encouraged and where substantial professional feedback is received so that improvement of both products and people is continually sought.
